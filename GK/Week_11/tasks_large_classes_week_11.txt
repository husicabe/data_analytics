Tasks: 

1.) The exercises in this large class are designed to help deepen understanding of the word embedding concept.
    The example shows how neural networks can be used to train models that can be used to predict text based on 
	word embeddings. Note that the knowledge about the functionality of neural networks is not part of the 
	written exam.

2.) Try to run the Jupyter notebook and understand what the Python code is doing.

3.) Learn how text data is prepared, how how neural networks can be used to create word embeddings and to predict
    target words based on continuous bag-of-words (CBOW).
